# Night One - Early Evening

Here on the Pacific coast the Rumble starts at 5 pm. I traveled up from San Diego (where it was raining) to Portland (where it is always raining) yesterday and am totally ready for the startter gun to go off.  Our team has met a few set backs already: Matt flew out this afternoon to go to a funeral and won't be able to join us until late Saturday and we discovered last night that Nic is too allergic to Matt's cats to do the rumble at our planned location.  But I'm still very optimistic. Our idea is sound, we've got a broadly experianced team and some basic wireframe ideas already in front of us. We are ready. Here we go!
