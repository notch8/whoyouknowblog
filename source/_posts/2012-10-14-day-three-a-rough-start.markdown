This morning was a rough one.  We were so tired last night that we didn't really set up when and how we'd get together today. This morning it was like herding cats.  Speaking of cats, we tried a coffee shop to keep Nic from having an allergy attack, but the one we chose had no WIFI and closed at 3.  After our double fail we ended up finally all getting together at 12:30 at a [Panera Cares](http://paneracares.org), which is a really cool charity arm of Panera where folks donate what they can for their meals when they can.  What a great atmosphere for us to sprint to the finish.
