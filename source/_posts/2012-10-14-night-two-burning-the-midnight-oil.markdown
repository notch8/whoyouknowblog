![Developers Working](/images/photo2.jpg)

Huge developer day today.  David, Nic and I pushed hard all day long, breaking only for Mexican food and coffee.  We have a styles in place, the vast majority of the backend work done and a really solid experiance. It was a huge moment when we each loaded up our LinkedIn profiles and saw that we all actually had matches with our data! It really felt good to validate the concept and see interesting results right off the bat.

Our team was finally fully assembled around 10:00 pm tonight as Matt's flight got it and he made his way to the dev cave. The four of us have talked about when to feature freeze (1pm tomorrow) and what fancy things we'd like to add now that the basic features are all up.  Favorites, the last of the prediscussed features, is getting wrapped up right now and then it is time for some sleep.
