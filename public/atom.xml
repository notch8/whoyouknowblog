    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Night One - 11pm</h1>

<p>Our goals for the tonight where to get a Rails template generated (go go gadget rails_app_composer), login with LinkedIn working and the deployment fully functioning.  I was feeling like if we could do that and still get a solid nights sleep we&#8217;d be in a really solid place to tacle the main app functionality tomorrow.  8:30 pm was way to early to go to bed and that&#8217;s when we&#8217;d met that goal.  So we grabbed some beers, double down on our goals and started parsing job feeds and LinkedIn data.  I&#8217;m feeling really great about where we are and am still looking a full night sleep tonight.  That should leave our team in a great place tomorrow.  Looking at the other entries, I&#8217;m astonded by how many don&#8217;t have project names or descriptions yet.  I would have thought more people would have done the pre work.  And I don&#8217;t see hardly any that are deployed yet.  Feels good to be out in front.</p>

<p>Here on the Pacific coast the Rumble starts at 5 pm. I traveled up from San Diego (where it was raining) to Portland (where it is always raining) yesterday and am totally ready for the startter gun to go off.  Our team has met a few set backs already: Matt flew out this afternoon to go to a funeral and won&#8217;t be able to join us until late Saturday and we discovered last night that Nic is too allergic to Matt&#8217;s cats to do the rumble at our planned location.  But I&#8217;m still very optimistic. Our idea is sound, we&#8217;ve got a broadly experianced team and some basic wireframe ideas already in front of us. We are ready. Here we go!</p>
